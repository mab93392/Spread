What is it?

    It is a series of scripts that pulls team stats and scores from the NHL's 
    API and performs a multivariate linear regression to form a model
    to predict a score differential.

Status:

    Multivariate linear regression was successfully performed. However, score 
     differential and team stats are strongly correleated enough to yeild a 
     useful linear model.
